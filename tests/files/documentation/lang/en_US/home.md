## What is Mapcraft ?

Mapcraft is a package consisting of a software, a resourcepack and a datapack. Acting as a giant toolbox, Mapcraft increases without configuration the possibilities of mapmakers. Its great advantage is its simplicity, all modifications made by the software are directly applied to your world, and vice versa.

	<p style="text-align: center;">Mapcraft being under development and still in alpha, it is always possible to encounter bugs. Nevertheless, most of the time, it will work without any real problem</p>

## How it works ?

		<p>The diagram will allow you to better visualize the operation and these steps :</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Mapcraft will link to your world</li>
			<li>Installation of the datapack and the official resource pack in your world, making the development tools accessible in the game</li>
			<li>Creation of the resourcepack and datapack containing all the content that will be created</li>
			<li>Live reading of the game log file, allowing Mapcraft to read the chat and detect shell commands sent in it</li>
		</ol>
