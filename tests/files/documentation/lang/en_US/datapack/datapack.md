## Datapack

> This section contains all the information to use the functions present by default in the datapack.

You can use these functions when developing your datapack. They can be useful on many points, so don't hesitate to use them!

- [Instant teleportation](datapack/instant_tp)
- [Mathematics](datapack/math)
- [Player](datapack/player)
- [Targeted block](datapack/targeted_block)

## Why use this datapack?
This one is very much inspired by the [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/started.html) approach :
- Its objective is not to provide you a strong abstraction during your development and to do "magic", but to assist you in your development cycle
- Each function has been designed to be simple to use and understand. They are always accompanied by an explanation in the documentation
- These functions have already proven their reliability on other projects of different sizes
- This datapack is under open source license and open source, nothing prevents you to go and see how they work

In short, you have all along an absolute control when using them, and you can even adapt them to your own use without any problem !
