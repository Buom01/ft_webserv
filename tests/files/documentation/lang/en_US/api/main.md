## Stability index
Throughout the documentation you will find indications about the stability of a function. Some APIs are so proven and reliable that they are unlikely to ever change. Others, on the other hand, are new and experimental, or known to be dangerous.

The stability indices are as follows:
<div class="stab deprecated">
	<h3>
		<span>⚠</span>Deprecated
	</h3>
	<p>The function may issue warnings. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stab experimental">
	<h3>
		<span>⚙</span>Experimental
	</h3>
	<p>This function is not subject to semantic versioning rules. Changes or deletions that are not backwards compatible may occur in any subsequent release. The use of this feature is not recommended in production environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="stab stable">
	<h3>
		<span>⛉</span>Stable
	</h3>
	<p>This function can be used without risk.</p>
</div>

## Well started

This documentation works under the assumption that the reader is familiar with NodeJS and general web development (knowing a little ElectronJS is a plus but not required). If you need to be more comfortable with either of these areas, we recommend the following resources:

- [Getting Started with the Web (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
- [Introduction to NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/learn)

It is strongly recommended that you follow the [Getting Started](api/getting_started) documentation page when creating your first project.
