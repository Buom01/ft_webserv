### Start
When launching the application, the following window will appear in the middle of your window.

![Select_user_1](./srcs/img/data/main_window/select_user_1.png)

If this is your first connection, no user will be available. This is normal, you will have to create your personal account. To do this click on the bottom left button ``Create``, a window will open.

![Select_user_2](./srcs/img/data/main_window/select_user_2.png)

Enter your nickname in the input box, and validate. If no errors are found, close the window and your account will appear in the list.
If you want to remember your account for your next connection, select ``Remembering my choice``, and validate.
