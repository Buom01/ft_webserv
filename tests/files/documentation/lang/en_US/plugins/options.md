> This window will allow you to easily activate/deactivate or delete the installed plugins

Two panels are present:
- **Built-in**: contains all the plugins integrated directly to Mapcraft. Some very specific plugins  can't be deactivated to avoid major malfunction of the software.
- **Installed**: contains all the plugins installed and developed by external developers. You can either activate/deactivate the plugins or delete them. Clicking on the orange button at the top of the page will force Mapcraft to update the plugins to the latest version available.
##### <span>&#x26a0;</span> You cannot remove built-ins, but you can disable them
